## Development
This project includes a devcontainer running redis and mariadb for use in development. To open the devcontainer in VSCode, first make sure you have the `Dev Containers` extension installed and running. Then press **CTRL+SHIFT+P** and type in `Reopen in Container`. VSCode will now build the container and set up a new workspace in it.
